# Game Merch Store for Phasmophobia and Valorant Merch ðŸš€ðŸŽ®  

In my first year at university, I dived into the world of web development and built a **Game Merch Store** from scratch as part of my coursework. This online store is equipped with all the necessary features, such as a sign-in and log-in page, a homepage, a dedicated selling page showcasing Phasmophobia and Valorant merchandise along with their respective information pages.  
- The frontend is crafted using **React.js** and **TailwindCSS**, making it modern, sleek, and fully responsive! ðŸ’»âœ¨  
- The backend however is done with **Express Js** , **Node Js** and **Mongodb** making it a MERN stack project.

## Shoutouts  
A huge shoutout to my teammate, who crushed it with the **Valorant advertising page and the Valorant merch designs**. She also helped review the frontend and provided suggestions to improve its responsiveness and user-friendliness. You can check out her amazing work [here](https://github.com/absolutenobrainer333/WEB).  


Any improvement suggestions are appreciated. ðŸŽ®ðŸ”¥

# NOTES FROM THE README.MD CREATED BY REACT :)

<i>
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### npm run eject

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
